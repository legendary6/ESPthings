<b>Standing on the shoulders of ESP gods!</b>

This library is my attempt at learning ESP8266/ESP32 MCUs. The goal of this project is to ease the process of prototyping on these MCUs using Arduino IDE. Most of the code will be high level using libraries created by the community. Feel free to contribute!
